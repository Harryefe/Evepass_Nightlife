## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **Full Conversational AI Experience**
Your Eve AI assistant now uses ElevenLabs' advanced Conversational AI, which means:

- ✅ **Natural conversations** - Eve remembers context and responds intelligently
- ✅ **Voice input** - Speak directly to Eve using the microphone button
- ✅ **Voice output** - Eve responds with natural speech
- ✅ **Real-time processing** - Faster, more natural interactions
- ✅ **Persistent conversations** - Eve remembers your conversation history

### **Two Modes Available**
1. **Conversational AI Mode** (Default) - Full agent experience
2. **Text-to-Speech Mode** - Fallback for basic voice synthesis

## 🎯 **Testing Your Agent**

### **Step 1: Restart Your Development Server**
```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
